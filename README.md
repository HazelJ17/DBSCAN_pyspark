# DBSCAN_pyspark
Implement distributed DBSCAN algorithm using Pyspark

Source Code (jupyter notebook) running on Kaggle

We implemented distributed DBSCAN with Pyspark using the MapReduce method with a single computation node.

We used four synthetic Datasets running on the DBSCAN algorithm in sklearn as comparison to the proposed algorithm, finding that the proposed algorithm is as accurate as DBSCAN in sklearn but much slower computation time.
